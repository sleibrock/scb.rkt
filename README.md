ssh-chat Bot Framework
===
A Racket library for developing [ssh-chat](https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat) bots.

Goals:
* create a bot that is easy to bind with chat-invoked functions
* create a bot that is easy to schedule functions on intervals
* create a bot capable of responding to messages automatically

The API is not stable in it's current state and the design is subject to change.
